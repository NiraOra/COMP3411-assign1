# COMP3411 Assign 1

Repo just in case collab for assignment yay

## Things to keep in mind

- need a makefile to compile the code
- A C file hashi w extra files if necessary (to seperate the data structure definitions or smth like that)
- anything else

## USING BRIDGEN

``` (terminal)
...$~ gcc bridgen.c -o bridgen (once)
...$~ ./bridgen X Y (X, Y are row and col dimensions that you want)

```

## USING BRIDGECHECK

``` (terminal)
...$~ gcc bridgen.c -o bridgen (once)
...$~ ./bridgecheck sX.in < sX.out (where sX.in is the input file and sX.out is the output file)
```
