# Code on here

- Idea: Node initialisation

                                NODE
                        |                   |
                    IslandNode              WaterNode
                    - has stuff             - has stuff    

- Just for testing extra:

1. Code for bridgen

```(terminal)
...$~ gcc bridgen.c -o bridgen (just once)
...$~ ./bridgen X Y (X is num of rows, Y is num of cols)

```

2. Code for bridgecheck

```(terminal)
...$~ gcc bridgecheck.c -o bridgecheck (just once)
...$~ ./bridgecheck sX.in < sX.out (or smth like this) (sX.in is input, sY.in is output)

```
